## Summary

A 25-year-old male patient presented with sharp chest pain localized over his heart, which started three days ago. The pain is intermittent, lasting a few seconds, worsens with coughing and lying down, and improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10 and sometimes feels it radiate to his neck. He denies shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, weakness, numbness, or other symptoms. He recently recovered from the flu but currently has no viral symptoms.

His medical history is unremarkable; he has no chronic conditions, surgeries, or allergies and only occasionally takes Tylenol. He does not smoke or use recreational drugs and drinks alcohol socially. He is a student studying engineering and works part-time as a postman, living with his mother.

Notably, his father recently died of a heart attack two weeks ago, which raises the patient's concern about having a heart attack himself. The clinician acknowledged the patient's anxiety, reassured him, and planned to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate his heart function. The patient was advised not to worry excessively until test results are available.
