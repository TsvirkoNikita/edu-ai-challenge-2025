3. **Set up your OpenAI API key**:
   
   **Option A: Using .env file (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your API key
   # Replace 'your_openai_api_key_here' with your actual key
   ```
   
   **Option B: Using environment variable**
   ```bash
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   
   # Windows (Command Prompt)
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
   # macOS/Linux
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

**Analyze a known service:**
```bash
python service_analyzer.py --service "Spotify"
python service_analyzer.py --service "Notion"
python service_analyzer.py --service "Netflix"
```

**Analyze custom service description:**
```bash
python service_analyzer.py --text "A collaborative platform for remote teams that combines video conferencing, document sharing, and project management in one unified workspace"
```

**Save report to file:**
```bash
python service_analyzer.py --service "Discord" --output discord_analysis.md
```

**Interactive mode:**

2. Choose between known service or custom description
3. Enter your input
4. View the generated report
5. Optionally save to file
6. Continue with more analyses or quit

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found"**
- Ensure you've set up your API key correctly (see Installation step 3)
- Check that your `.env` file is in the same directory as the script
- Verify the API key is valid and has sufficient credits

**"Error generating report: ..."**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- Try again as it might be a temporary API issue

**Import errors**
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
- Ensure you're using Python 3.7 or higher

### Getting Help

1. Check that all files are in the same directory
2. Verify Python version: `python --version`
3. Test API key: Try a simple known service first
4. Check OpenAI status: [status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com)

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file or API keys to version control
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` for safety
- Use environment variables in production environments
- Monitor your OpenAI API usage and costs

## Cost Considerations

- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model (cost-effective)
- Average cost per report: ~$0.01-0.05
- Set usage limits in your OpenAI dashboard if needed
